# F1-Project on Tyre Performance

This project aims at determining a tyre degradation model that can produce optimal tyre strategies for an F1 race.

For F1 data, we will be using the FastF1 Python library. Data will be used from 2023-2025 to model tyre degradation for this current F1 regulation period (2022-2025), with the exclusion of 2022 due to the return of porpoising which produced unstable ride and aerodynamic behaviour instability within many teams.

On the outset, we will be using Free Practice data to eliminate the effects of racing, tyre-saving, and fuel-saving on tyre performance, amongst other factors.
